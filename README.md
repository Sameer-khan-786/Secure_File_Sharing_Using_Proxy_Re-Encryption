In todayâ€™s digital age, the secure and efficient sharing
of sensitive information is of utmost importance. This project
aims to develop a Secure File Sharing System that utilizes
advanced proxy re-encryption methods to ensure robust data
security and flexible access control. The system employs a
sophisticated cryptographic framework to facilitate secure
encryption, transmission, and decryption of files, effectively
mitigating risks of unauthorized access. The architecture of the
system is designed around secure user authentication mechanisms, role-based access controls, and a Java-based backend
that handles complex encryption and decryption processes.
The system is complemented by a dynamic web interface
that uses JavaServer Pages (JSP), allowing for user-friendly
functionalities such as file uploads, downloads, and secure
access management.
By using proxy re-encryption, the system allows files to be
securely re-encrypted and accessed by new users, while keeping
the underlying data hidden. This approach enhances both
security and usability, making it more difficult for cyber threats
to compromise the system. The implementation showcases a
practical solution for secure file sharing within organizations,
highlighting its potential to revolutionize data protection strategies in various business and technology landscapes
